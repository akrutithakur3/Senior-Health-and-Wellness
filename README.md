A website called the Senior Health and Wellness initiative attempts to offer tools and information to assist seniors in maintaining their health and wellness. The website's user interface and navigation will be intuitive. The parts will be primarily geared towards the requirements of elderly citizens and cover things like fitness, diet, mental health and socilization.
There are 4 sections in which nutrition section shows what diet need to be followed by seniors, fitness contains sub sections like yoga, cardio, strength training, mental health section is there and socializing section is also there.
The website is be designed with accessibility in mind, with a clean and simple layout that is easy to read and navigate. The content is written in plain language, making it easy for seniors with varying levels of health literacy to understand.
